## User Stories

Ben's suggestions of user stories to work on:

- *As a user, when I create a new project I should become that project’s owner*
- As a project owner I should not be able to back my own project
- As a project owner, when I go to my project’s page, I should see a list of who has backed my project
- *As a project owner, when I go to my project’s page, I should see a summary of how many rewards have been claimed*
- *As a project owner, when I create a new project, I should have the option of setting a limit for how many times a specific reward can be claimed*
- As a project owner, when I create a new project, I should be able to upload a picture from my computer instead of linking to an online image (https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave)
- *As a project owner I should be able to post updates on the progess of my project.*
- As a backer, when I go to the page of a project I have backed, I should see all the updates from the owner in reverse chronological order
- As a user, when I go to the page of a fully funded project that is past its deadline that I have not backed, I should only see updates about that project from before the funding deadline. Updates for funded projects that were made after funding ended are for backers’ (and the owner’s) eyes only.
- *As a backer I should be able to leave a comment on a project I have backed*
- As a backer I should be able to leave a comment on a project update. This should happen via AJAX

- *As a user, when I go to a project’s page, I should see how much money has been pledged so far*
- *As a user, when I go to a project’s page, it should tell me if I have already backed that project or not*
- *As a user, when I go to a project’s page, it should tell me how much time is left until the funding deadline (like it does on the project index currently)*
