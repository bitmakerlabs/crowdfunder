*** As a project owner, when I go to my project’s page, I should see a list of who
  has backed my project
*** As a user, when I go to a project’s page, I should see how much money has been
  pledged so far
***! As a user, when I go to a project’s page, it should tell me if I have already
          backed that project or not
*** As a user, when I go to a project’s page, it should tell me how much time is
          left until the funding deadline (like it does on the project index currently)

*** Project start date must be in future
*** Project end date must be later than start date
*** A project's goal must be positive number
